## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a different way to grab form elements for validating. Normally, I'd just id's but this time I used a different approach, found in "main.js". It was refreshing using vanilla js to handle a form as I'm so used to using react and state and no document get element by this and that, so it was nice. I practiced making sure everything is accessible and tabbable as well.
